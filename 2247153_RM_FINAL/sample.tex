\section{Enunciations}

\begin{theorem}\label{T0.1}
Assume that $\alpha>0, \gamma>1, \beta>\frac{\gamma+1}{\gamma-1}$.
Then there exists a small $\tau_1>0$, such that for $\tau\in
[0,\tau_1)$, if $c$ crosses $c(\tau)$ from the direction of
to  a small amplitude periodic traveling wave solution of
(2.1), and the period of $(\check{u}^p(s),\check{w}^p(s))$ is
\[
\check{T}(c)=c\cdot \left[\frac{2\pi}{\omega(\tau)}+O(c-c(\tau))\right].
\]
\end{theorem}


\begin{condition}\label{C2.2}
From (0.8) and (2.10), it holds
$\frac{d\omega}{d\tau}<0,\frac{dc}{d\tau}<0$ for $\tau\in
[0,\tau_1)$. This fact yields that the system (2.1) with delay
$\tau>0$ has the periodic traveling waves for smaller wave speed $c$
than that the system (2.1) with $\tau=0$ does. That is, the
delay perturbation stimulates an early occurrence of the traveling waves.
\end{condition}
